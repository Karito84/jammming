This is a project I finished while studying the Front-End Engineer Path on Codecademy. I was supposed to build a React web application using my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with Spotify API. The application had to allow users to search the [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. This is my web app: [music-all.surge.sh](http://music-all.surge.sh).
