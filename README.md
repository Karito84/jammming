# Jammming

This is a project I finished while studying the Front-End Engineer Path on Codecademy. I was supposed to build a React web application using my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with Spotify API. 

## Part one: Create the app
The application had to allow users to search the [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account. This is my web app: [karolina-jammming.netlify.app/](https://karolina-jammming.netlify.app/).

## Part two: Adding a feature to my Jammming app

I was asked to use a technical design document template to show all the necessary functionality of my new feature, and the implementation. 
The project included an example of a technical design document for implementing multiple playlists in Jammming as a resource . It was supposed to help me in deciding what level of information I should include in my own design document.<br>
For more practice I decided to implement the given example first. My updated app now retrieves user's existing playlists, lets the user pick any one of them, and update it's name and/or tracks, and then save it to the Spotify account. 

For my own new feature I picked to include samples for each track. Below is my technical design document for the feature: [Feature Request: Include Preview Samples For Each Track](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSjNwsCy7w9BYI3EEsBB9AI6fpCwORDiSquUw8IrpDz7PzhO_GurEsd5MnQlYDJ6e9Nd1W0-JrKLzTX/pub).
